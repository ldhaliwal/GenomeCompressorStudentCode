| November 12 | 11:25-11:55 |                                                                                                       Started writing, using 7 bits to represent each char, works, but is significantly less compression (like 90%), started thinking about using 2 bits to represent |
| November 13 |    7-8pm    | finished writing code to work with two bits, got stuck for a while because I messed up the order of my keys in the expand method (it was ACGT in compress but ACTG in expand). Still gives me an extra 'A' at the end when I compress, not really sure how to fix it. |
